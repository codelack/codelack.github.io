    <p>This is a 3-scene composition with quite a random, dark, and spooky storyline.</p>
    <p>The assignment for this was to make a compositing video including a title card, parallax, credits, sound effects, and about a minute's length. It was for the class â€œdigital studio I."</p>
    <p>I used many creative commons zero sound effects to compose the music together in Adobe Audition. I also used a creative commons zero model of a skull and rendered it in Blender, as well as a <a href="http://www.blendswap.com/user/Chaiwit_Jarunyakorn" target="_blank">model</a> of a house.</p>
